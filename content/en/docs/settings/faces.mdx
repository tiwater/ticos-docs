# Face Management

Face Management is a global feature that allows you to create a shared face recognition database for all terminals under your account. By uploading and labeling face images, you can empower your Embodied Agents to recognize specific individuals, leading to more personalized and intelligent interactions.

## Prerequisites

To use the Face Management feature, you must meet the following condition:

-   **Available Online Terminal**: You must have at least one terminal registered and in an "online" state. You will need to select an online terminal from the dropdown menu at the top of the page before you can start managing face data.

## Key Features

After successfully selecting an online terminal, you will typically be able to perform the following actions:

### 1. View Existing Faces

The page will display all currently registered faces in the database, usually with a preview image and the name you've assigned to each face.

### 2. Add New Faces

-   **Upload Image**: You can click an "Add Face" or similar button to upload an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG) containing a clear face from your local device.
-   **Name Face**: After a successful upload, you will be prompted to enter a unique name for the face (e.g., "John Doe"). This name will serve as the identifier for that person.

### 3. Manage Faces

For each existing face, you can typically perform the following management operations:

-   **Edit Name**: Modify the name associated with an existing face.
-   **Delete Face**: Permanently remove a face from the database. This is an irreversible action, so use it with caution.

## Usage Flow

1.  **Navigate**: Go to "Settings" from the main left-hand menu, then select "Faces".
2.  **Select Terminal**: Choose an online terminal from the dropdown menu at the top of the page.
3.  **Manage Faces**: Perform add, edit, or delete operations as needed.
4.  **Synchronization**: Changes you make are typically automatically synchronized to all terminal devices connected to your account.

## Important Notes

-   Uploaded face images should be as clear, front-facing, and unobstructed as possible to improve recognition accuracy.
-   Face names should be unique within the database to avoid confusion.
-   Deleting a face means the agent will no longer be able to recognize that individual.
