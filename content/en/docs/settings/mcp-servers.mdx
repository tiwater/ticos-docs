# MCP Servers

MCP (Multimodal Coordination Protocol) Servers are a core mechanism in the Ticos platform for extending the capabilities of Embodied Agents. Through MCP Servers, your agents can interact with external systems, third-party APIs, or custom business logic, enabling them to perform complex tasks beyond their built-in functions.

For example, you could create an MCP Server to:
-   Query a weather forecast API.
-   Control smart home devices.
-   Connect to a company's internal knowledge base.
-   Perform custom computational tasks.

## Key Features (Intended)

A fully functional "MCP Servers" management page would typically allow you to:

-   **View Server List**: Display all registered MCP servers, including their names, descriptions, endpoint addresses, and statuses.
-   **Register New Server**: Provide a form to add a new MCP server. You would need to supply the server's name, description, API endpoint URL, and any necessary authentication details (like API keys).
-   **Edit Server Configuration**: Modify the details of an already registered server.
-   **Enable/Disable Server**: Temporarily activate or deactivate a server without deleting it from the platform.
-   **Delete Server**: Permanently remove an MCP server.
