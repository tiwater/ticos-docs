# Usage Statistics

The Usage Statistics page provides insights into your consumption of Ticos platform resources, particularly focusing on API usage and other metered services. This helps you track your activity, understand billing, and optimize your applications.

As indicated by the page title (e.g., `ref=e65`) and description (e.g., `ref=e66`), its primary purpose is to "View your API usage metrics."

## Accessing Usage Statistics

To access the Usage Statistics page:

1.  Click on your user avatar or profile icon, typically located in the top-right corner of the platform interface.
2.  From the dropdown menu, select "Account Settings" or a similar option.
3.  Within the account settings, navigate to the "Usage" section (e.g., via a sidebar link `ref=e54`).

## Key Features (Intended & Observed)

Based on typical usage dashboards and the current page elements, you can expect the following features:

-   **Date Range Selection**: A date picker (e.g., `ref=e68`) allows you to select a specific period for which to view usage data. This is crucial for analyzing trends or checking consumption for a particular billing cycle.
-   **API Call Metrics**: Detailed statistics on your API calls, which might include:
    -   Total number of API requests.
    -   Breakdown of calls by API endpoint or service.
    -   Successful vs. failed requests.
    -   Data transfer volume (ingress/egress).
-   **Resource Consumption**: Information on other billable resources, such as:
    -   Storage used (e.g., for knowledge bases, agent configurations).
    -   Active terminal hours.
    -   Model inference time or tokens consumed.
-   **Graphical Representations**: Usage data is often presented in charts and graphs for easy visualization of trends and patterns.
-   **Data Export (Potentially)**: Some platforms allow you to export usage data in formats like CSV for offline analysis or record-keeping.

## Understanding Your Usage

Regularly reviewing your usage statistics can help you:

-   **Monitor Costs**: Keep track of your spending if your usage is tied to a pricing plan.
-   **Identify Trends**: Understand how your application's usage of Ticos services changes over time.
-   **Optimize Performance**: Pinpoint frequently used or resource-intensive API calls that could be optimized.
-   **Capacity Planning**: Forecast future needs based on historical usage patterns.

## Notes

-   The specific metrics available may depend on your subscription level and the services you use on the Ticos platform.
-   There might be a delay in reporting usage data, so the statistics shown may not be real-time to the exact second.
-   If you have questions about your usage or billing, refer to the platform's pricing page or contact support.
