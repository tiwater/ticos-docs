# Terminal Models

The "Terminal Models" page is intended to provide a list of officially supported and pre-configured terminal hardware devices. Here, users would typically be able to view technical specifications, features, and suitable use cases for different terminal models, aiding in the selection of the most appropriate hardware for their applications.

## Key Features (Intended)

A fully functional "Terminal Models" page would generally include:

-   **Model List**: Display all compatible terminal device models, including images, names, and key feature summaries.
-   **Detailed Specifications**: Upon selecting a specific model, users could view its detailed technical parameters, such as processor, memory, camera specifications, sensor types, connectivity options, etc.
-   **Purchase Links**: Links to official or recommended channels for purchasing the hardware.
-   **Setup Guides**: Links to quick start guides and configuration documentation for specific models.
