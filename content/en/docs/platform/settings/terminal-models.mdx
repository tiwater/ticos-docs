# Terminal Models

The "Terminal Models" page provides a list of officially supported and pre-configured terminal hardware devices. Users can view technical specifications, features, and applicable scenarios for different terminal models to select the most suitable hardware for their applications.

## Main Features

The main interface displays the following information:

- **Model List**: Shows all terminal device models, including type images, names, and key feature summaries.
- **Detailed Specifications**: After clicking on a specific model, you can view its detailed technical parameters and related information.

## Adding or Editing Terminal Models

After clicking the "Add Model" button, a dialog box will appear for defining or editing terminal models, including the following fields:

- **Terminal Image**: Click to upload a terminal device image for display in the model list.
- **Brand / Manufacturer**: Enter the terminal's brand or manufacturer information.
- **Terminal Type**: Select the terminal type (such as robot, vehicle, camera, etc.).
- **Name**: Specify a unique name for the terminal model for easy identification and management.
- **Description**: Add supplementary information about the terminal model's features, applicable scenarios, etc.

At the bottom of the dialog box, operation buttons are provided:

- **Published**: Indicates whether the model has been published. Published models can be used directly in terminal management and other modules.
- **Cancel**: Abandon the current edit and close the dialog box.
- **Save**: Save the entered model information.

> Please ensure all required fields are completed to facilitate subsequent terminal device configuration and management.
