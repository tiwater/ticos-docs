# MCP Services

MCP (Model Context Protocol) services are a core mechanism in the Ticos platform for extending the capabilities of Embodied Agents. Through MCP services, your agents can interact with external systems, third-party APIs, or custom business logic, enabling them to perform complex tasks beyond their built-in functions.

For example, you could register an MCP service to:
-   Query a weather forecast API.
-   Control smart home devices.
-   Connect to a company's internal knowledge base.
-   Perform custom computational tasks.

## Key Features

You can perform the following operations in this module:

-   **View Service List**: Display all registered MCP services, including their names, descriptions, endpoint addresses, and statuses.
-   **Register New Service**: Add a new MCP service. You need to provide the service's name, description, API endpoint URL, and necessary authentication information (such as API keys).
-   **Edit Service Configuration**: Modify the details of an already registered service.
-   **Delete Service**: Permanently remove an MCP service.

## Support Status

- Server-side Stardust model supports SSE MCP services in realtime mode.
- Server-side OpenAI gpt models support both SSE and Streamable HTTP MCP services in agent responses mode.
