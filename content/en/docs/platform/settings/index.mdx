# Settings Overview

The Settings module is your central hub for managing global configurations for the Ticos platform. These settings generally apply across all your terminals and agents, or define resources available to them, rather than being specific to a single Embodied Agent.

You can use the sub-menu on the left to navigate between the different settings pages.

## Settings Modules

Below are the main configuration pages available within the Settings module:

-   **[Faces](./faces.mdx)**: Manage the shared face recognition database for all terminals under your account. You can upload, name, and delete faces to enable your agents to recognize specific individuals.

-   **[Terminal Models](./terminal-models.mdx)**: View and manage the supported terminal device models on the platform. This provides a reference for selecting and configuring your hardware terminals.

-   **[MCP Servers](./mcp-servers.mdx)**: Configure and manage Multimodal Coordination Protocol (MCP) servers. MCP servers allow agents to interact with external systems or APIs, thereby extending their capabilities.
