# Skills

The "Skills" module allows you to add and manage capabilities for your agent to perform specific tasks, interact with external systems, or process advanced information. These skills are essentially tools or functions that the agent can call.

## Overview

The "Skills" page contains the following core sections:

- **Page Title**: "Skills".
- **Content Area**: This area will list all skills already added to the agent. If no skills have been added yet, a corresponding prompt message will be displayed.
- **Primary Action**: Button for adding new skills.

## Adding Skills

You can add new skills to your agent in the following ways:

1.  **Create New Skill**
    -   **Functionality**: Clicking this button will open an interface that allows you to define a new skill from scratch. You'll need to specify the skill's name, description, input/output parameters, and write its business logic or connect it to a specified API endpoint.

2.  **Add from Library**
    -   **Functionality**: This option allows you to access a pre-set skill library. You can browse or search this library, select common skills provided by the platform or shared by the community, and add them directly to your agent.

3.  **Add from MCP Server**
    -   **Functionality**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend agent capabilities by providing access to specialized functions or external information. This option allows you to connect your agent to an MCP server and integrate skills hosted on it.

## Managing Existing Skills

After skills are added to the agent, you can manage them on this page:

-   View details of configured skills.
-   Configure parameters or settings for individual skills.
-   Remove skills that are no longer needed.

Equipping your agent with the right combination of skills is key to enabling it to perform a wide range of tasks and interact effectively with users and systems.
