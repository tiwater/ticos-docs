# Agent Skills (Tools)

The "Skills" module in the agent configuration allows you to manage the specific capabilities, tools, or functions that your Embodied Agent can utilize to perform tasks, interact with external systems, or process information in advanced ways.

**Note on Terminology**: During initial platform exploration, this section was anticipated as "Tools." The presence of a "Skills" page (`/en/agents/33/skills`) suggests this might be the designated area for managing such functionalities. Confirmation on whether "Skills" directly replaces or is equivalent to "Tools" is pending (see MEMORY[eb2b0bab-3efa-4e91-a558-c298f4c2d3ba]).

## Overview

When you navigate to the Skills section, you will typically see:

- **Page Title**: "Skills"
- **Content Area**: This area will list any skills already added to the agent. If no skills are present, it might display a message indicating so.
- **Primary Actions**: Buttons to add new skills.

## Adding Skills

The interface provides several ways to add skills to your agent:

1.  **Create New Button** (e.g., `ref=e151` from exploration)
    -   **Functionality**: This option likely opens a dialog or interface for defining a new skill from scratch. This might involve specifying the skill's name, description, input/output parameters, and potentially scripting its logic or connecting it to an API endpoint.

2.  **Add from Library Button** (e.g., `ref=e155` from exploration)
    -   **Functionality**: This suggests access to a pre-existing library of skills. You would be able to browse or search this library and select skills to add to your agent. These could be common, reusable skills provided by the platform or shared by other users.

3.  **Add from MCP Server Button** (e.g., `ref=e159` from exploration)
    -   **Functionality**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend agent capabilities by providing access to specialized functions or external information. This option would allow you to connect your agent to an MCP server and integrate skills hosted on it.

## Managing Existing Skills

Once skills are added, this section would typically also provide tools to:

-   View details of configured skills.
-   Enable or disable specific skills for the agent.
-   Configure parameters or settings for individual skills.
-   Remove skills that are no longer needed.

(The specific UI for managing existing skills and the detailed process for adding/configuring each type of skill would require further exploration once a skill is added.)

Equipping your agent with the right set of skills is crucial for enabling it to perform a wide range of tasks and interact effectively with users and systems.
