# Gesture (Under Development)

The "Gesture" module is used for configuring and testing gesture recognition functionality.

## Configuration Options

### Predefined Gestures

- The system includes multiple built-in common gestures that can be directly used, including:
    - **Wave**: A standard waving motion.
    - **Thumbs Up**: Expresses agreement or positivity.
    - **Point**: Used to guide user attention.
    - **Clap**: Used for cheering or expressing enthusiasm.
- Each gesture can be operated as follows:
    - **Calibrate**: Start the calibration process for that gesture to ensure accurate and smooth movement.
    - **Reset**: Restore the gesture to its default state.

### Custom Gestures

- Support for creating or importing custom gestures (if this feature is available on the platform) can be managed in this section.

Properly configuring and using gestures helps enhance the agent's non-verbal communication capabilities, making human-machine interaction more lively and intuitive.
