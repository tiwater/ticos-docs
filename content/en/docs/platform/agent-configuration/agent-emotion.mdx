# Emotion (Under Development)

The "Emotion" module is used to configure how the agent expresses emotions, affecting its personalized performance and interactive experience.

## Configuration Options

### Emotion Intensity

- Set the overall intensity level of the agent's emotional expression through a dropdown menu.
- Further specify facial expression types, or quickly find specific emotions using the search box.

### Emotion Transitions

- Configure how the agent smoothly transitions from one emotional state to another.
- Set transition speed (such as progressive or sudden) and style to ensure emotional changes appear natural and believable.
- Automatically trigger emotion switching based on events or inputs.

## General Notes

- Properly configuring emotional reactions can make the agent more approachable and improve the overall user experience.
- It is recommended to keep emotional expressions consistent with the agent's role and scenario.
