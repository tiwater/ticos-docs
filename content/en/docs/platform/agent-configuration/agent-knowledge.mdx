# Agent Knowledge Base

The "Knowledge" module allows you to manage the knowledge base that your Embodied Agent uses to draw information, answer questions, and perform tasks. A well-curated knowledge base is essential for creating an intelligent and helpful agent.

## Overview

When you navigate to the Knowledge section for your agent, you will typically see:

- **Page Title**: "Knowledge Base"
- **Content Area**: If no knowledge has been added yet, you might see messages like "No knowledge has been added yet." and "Add knowledge to make your agent smarter."
- **Primary Action**: An "Add Knowledge" button.

## Adding Knowledge

To add new information to your agent's knowledge base, you use the "Add Knowledge" feature.

1.  **Click the "Add Knowledge" Button** (e.g., `ref=e150` from exploration).
    This action will open a dialog box titled "Add Knowledge" (e.g., `ref=e157`).

2.  **Fill in the Knowledge Details**:
    The dialog typically contains the following fields:

    -   **Name** (e.g., textbox `ref=e162`):
        -   **Description**: A concise and descriptive name for the knowledge item or document you are adding.
        -   **Example**: "Product Specifications Q1 2024"

    -   **Description** (e.g., textbox `ref=e165`):
        -   **Description**: A more detailed summary of the content or purpose of this knowledge item.
        -   **Example**: "Contains detailed specifications for all products launched in the first quarter of 2024, including dimensions, materials, and features."

    -   **Tags** (e.g., textbox `ref=e168`):
        -   **Description**: Keywords or labels to help categorize and search for this knowledge item. Tags can be comma-separated or space-separated, depending on the system's implementation.
        -   **Example**: "product, specs, Q1, 2024, hardware"

3.  **Submit the Knowledge Item**:
    The dialog will have several action buttons:

    -   **Cancel Button** (e.g., `ref=e170`): Closes the dialog without saving any changes.
    -   **Add Knowledge Button** (e.g., `ref=e171`):
        -   **Functionality**: Submits the new knowledge item to the agent's knowledge base.
        -   **Note on Enablement**: During exploration, this button was observed to be initially disabled. The specific conditions required to enable this button (e.g., filling all fields, specific content format for an unobserved file upload field) were unclear and require further investigation (see MEMORY[eb2b0bab-3efa-4e91-a558-c298f4c2d3ba]).
    -   **Close Button** (e.g., `ref=e158`): Typically an 'X' icon at the top corner of the dialog to close it.

## Managing Existing Knowledge

Once knowledge items are added, this section would typically also provide tools to:

-   List and view existing knowledge items.
-   Search or filter through the knowledge base.
-   Edit or update existing items.
-   Delete items that are no longer relevant.

(The specific UI for managing existing knowledge was not fully explored as no knowledge was added during the initial sessions.)

Building a comprehensive and accurate knowledge base is an ongoing process that significantly enhances your agent's capabilities.
