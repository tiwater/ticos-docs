# Knowledge Base

The "Knowledge Base" module allows you to manage the knowledge base that your agent uses to extract information, answer questions, and perform tasks. A well-curated knowledge base is essential for creating an intelligent and useful agent.

## Overview

When you navigate to the agent's knowledge base section, you will typically see the following information:

- **Page Title**: "Knowledge Base"
- **Memory Function**: Enable the memory function for the knowledge base.
- **Script Function**: Configure conversation scripts for the agent.

## Memory Function

Configure the agent's memory function.

- **Enable Memory Function**: When enabled, the knowledge base will transform into the agent's long-term memory, providing a more comprehensive interactive experience. For terminal-level knowledge base upload and management, please refer to the relevant API documentation.

## Scripts

To add new information to your agent's script library, use the "Add Script" feature. When a user's conversation includes content from the script library, the agent will be able to generate responses based on the script content.

1.  **Click the "Add Script" Button**.
    This action will open a dialog box titled "Add Script".

2.  **Fill in the Knowledge Details**:
    The dialog typically contains the following fields:

    -   **Name**:
        -   **Description**: A concise and descriptive name for the knowledge item or document you are adding.
        -   **Example**: "Product Specifications Q1 2024"

    -   **Description**:
        -   **Description**: A more detailed summary of the content or purpose of this knowledge item.
        -   **Example**: "Contains detailed specifications for all products launched in the first quarter of 2024, including dimensions, materials, and features."

    -   **Tags**:
        -   **Description**: Keywords or labels to help categorize and search for this knowledge item. Tags can be comma-separated or space-separated, depending on the system's implementation.
        -   **Example**: "product, specs, Q1, 2024, hardware"

3.  **Submit the Knowledge Item**:
    The dialog will have several action buttons:

    -   **Cancel Button**: Closes the dialog without saving any changes.
    -   **Add Script Button**: Submits the new knowledge item to the agent's knowledge base.
    -   **Close Button**: Typically an 'X' icon at the top corner of the dialog to close it.

## Managing Existing Scripts

After adding script items, this section typically also provides the following tools:

-   List and view existing script items.
-   Edit or update existing items.
-   Delete items that are no longer relevant.

Building a comprehensive and accurate knowledge base is an ongoing process that significantly enhances your agent's capabilities.
