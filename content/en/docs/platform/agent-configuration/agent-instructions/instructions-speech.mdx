# Speech (Reaction)

The "Speech" settings, found under the "Instructions" -> "Reaction" module, allow you to customize how your Embodied Agent vocalizes its responses and interacts using voice.

## Configuration Options

### 1. Use Custom Voice ID

- **Control**: A toggle switch (e.g., `ref=e89` from exploration).
- **Functionality**: This option likely enables the use of a specific, pre-defined custom voice for the agent, potentially one that has been cloned or specially configured. When enabled, it might reveal an additional input field for the Custom Voice ID.

### 2. Voice Selection

- **Label**: Voice (or similar)
- **Control**: A dropdown menu (combobox, e.g., `ref=e96` from exploration).
- **Functionality**: Allows you to choose from a list of available standard voices for your agent. These voices can vary in gender, accent, and language.
- **Examples**: "Alice (English, US, Female)", "Mandarin Chinese, Female" (actual names might vary).

### 3. Speech Speed

- **Label**: Speech Speed (or similar)
- **Control**: A slider (e.g., `ref=e111` from exploration).
- **Functionality**: Adjusts how quickly the agent speaks. Moving the slider typically changes the words-per-minute rate.
- **Range**: Values might range from slower (e.g., 0.5x) to faster (e.g., 2.0x) than a standard speaking rate.

### 4. Voice Pitch

- **Label**: Voice Pitch (or similar)
- **Control**: A slider (e.g., `ref=e118` from exploration).
- **Functionality**: Modifies the pitch of the agent's voice, making it sound higher or lower.
- **Range**: Values could represent adjustments in semitones or a relative scale.

### 5. Volume

- **Label**: Volume (or similar)
- **Control**: A slider (e.g., `ref=e125` from exploration).
- **Functionality**: Controls the loudness of the agent's spoken output.

### 6. Test Speech

- **Functionality**: This feature allows you to preview the agent's voice with the current settings.
- **Components**:
    - **Text Input Field** (e.g., `ref=e134`): A textbox where you can type sample text for the agent to speak.
    - **"Test Speech" Button** (e.g., `ref=e130`): Clicking this button will make the agent vocalize the text entered in the input field using the selected voice, speed, pitch, and volume settings.

Careful configuration of these speech parameters is essential for creating an agent that is easy to understand and has a vocal persona consistent with its role and your brand.
