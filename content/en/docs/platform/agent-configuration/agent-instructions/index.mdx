# Agent Instructions

The "Instructions" module is a critical part of configuring your Embodied Agent. It allows you to define how your agent understands its core purpose, perceives its environment, and formulates its reactions.

This module is typically broken down into several sub-sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the agent's operational logic:

- **[Core Instructions](./instructions-core.mdx)**: Define the fundamental guidelines, personality, and primary objectives of your agent.
- **Perception**: Configure how your agent interprets sensory input.
    - **[Vision](./instructions-vision.mdx)**: Settings related to visual input, object recognition, and detail level.
    - **[Hearing](./instructions-hearing.mdx)**: Settings related to audio input and voice detection.
- **Reaction**: Determine how your agent responds and expresses itself.
    - **[Speech](./instructions-speech.mdx)**: Configure voice characteristics, speech patterns, and language.
    - **[Emotion](./instructions-emotion.mdx)**: Define emotional responses and expression intensity.
    - **[Gesture](./instructions-gesture.mdx)**: Manage physical gestures and idle movements.
    - **[Behavior](./instructions-behavior.mdx)**: *(Note: This section is currently under review as it was inaccessible during exploration.)* Intended for defining broader behavioral patterns and responses.

Detailed configuration options for each of these areas are covered in their respective pages. Effective instruction-setting is key to creating an agent that behaves consistently and aligns with your intended application.
