# Emotion (Reaction)

The "Emotion" settings, found under the "Instructions" -> "Reaction" module, allow you to configure how your Embodied Agent expresses emotions. This can significantly impact the agent's perceived personality and user engagement.

## Configuration Tabs

The Emotion configuration page is typically organized into two main tabs:

### 1. Emotion Intensity

- **Description**: This tab (e.g., selected by default, `ref=e90` from exploration) focuses on controlling the strength or subtlety of the agent's emotional expressions.
- **Key Controls** (based on exploration):
    - **Emotion Intensity Dropdown/Selection**: (e.g., `ref=e95`) Allows you to set a general level for how intensely emotions are displayed. Options might include 'Subtle', 'Normal', 'Exaggerated', or a numerical scale.
    - **Facial Expressions Button/Link**: (e.g., `ref=e105`) May lead to a more detailed configuration area for specific facial expressions linked to emotions.
    - **Search Box**: (e.g., `ref=e101`) Could be used to find specific emotions or expression settings if the list is extensive.

### 2. Emotion Transitions

- **Description**: This tab (e.g., `ref=e102`) likely deals with how the agent moves from one emotional state to another. Smooth and natural transitions are key to believable emotional expression.
- **Key Controls** (based on exploration, though details were not fully captured for this tab):
    - **Transition Speed/Style**: Settings to control the speed or manner of transitions (e.g., gradual, abrupt).
    - **Emotion Mapping**: Potentially rules or mappings for how certain events or inputs trigger emotional state changes.
    - **Search Box**: Similar to the Intensity tab, a search box might be present for navigating complex transition rules.

## General Functionality

- **Purpose**: The overall goal of this section is to allow fine-tuning of the agent's affective display. This can make interactions feel more natural, empathetic, or aligned with the agent's defined persona.
- **Considerations**: The specific emotions an agent can display and the granularity of control will depend on the underlying avatar and AI model capabilities.

Configuring emotional responses appropriately can make your agent more relatable and improve the overall user experience. However, it's important to ensure that emotional expressions are consistent with the agent's role and the context of the interaction.
