# Core Instructions

The "Core Instructions" section is where you define the fundamental operational guidelines and personality of your Embodied Agent. These instructions serve as the primary directive for the agent's behavior and responses.

## Configuration Options

### 1. Core Instructions Text Area

- **Description**: This is a large text field where you input the main set of instructions for your agent. These instructions can dictate its role, personality traits, how it should interact, what information it should prioritize, and any specific constraints or guidelines it must follow.
- **Usage**: You can write natural language instructions. For example, you might instruct the agent to be a helpful assistant, a knowledgeable expert on a specific topic, or to adopt a particular communication style (e.g., formal, casual, humorous).
- **Example Text**: `"You are a helpful and friendly assistant for the Ticos platform. Your goal is to provide accurate information about our services and guide users through common tasks. Always maintain a polite and professional tone."`

### 2. Response Language

- **Description**: This setting allows you to specify the primary language the agent should use for its responses.
- **Control**: Typically a dropdown menu listing available languages.
- **Example**: If you select "English (US)", the agent will primarily respond in American English. If you select "Chinese (Simplified)", it will respond in Simplified Chinese.
- **Note**: The agent's ability to understand and respond in different languages may depend on the underlying AI models and their multilingual capabilities.

Setting clear and comprehensive core instructions is crucial for ensuring your agent behaves as expected and effectively fulfills its intended purpose.
