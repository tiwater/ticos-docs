# Agent Dashboard (Overview)

The Agent Dashboard, also referred to as the Overview page, is the first screen you see after selecting an agent. It provides a summary of the agent's basic information and quick access to essential actions.

## Information Displayed

The dashboard typically displays the following details for the selected agent:

- **Agent Name**: The user-defined name of the agent (e.g., "Test Agent").
- **Agent ID**: A unique numerical identifier for the agent (e.g., "33").
- **Description**: A brief description of the agent's purpose or characteristics (e.g., "This is a test agent for documentation.").
- **Created**: The date and time when the agent was initially created (e.g., "2024-05-14 03:20:13").
- **Last Updated**: The date and time when the agent's configuration was last modified (e.g., "2024-05-14 03:20:13").

## Actions Available

From the dashboard, you can typically perform the following actions:

- **Edit**: Allows you to modify the agent's Name and Description. Clicking this button usually opens a dialog similar to the "Create New Agent" dialog.
- **Delete**: Permanently removes the agent and all its associated data. This action is usually irreversible and may require confirmation.

This page serves as a quick reference point for identifying your agent and understanding its basic status before diving into more detailed configurations.
