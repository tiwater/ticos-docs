# Agent Configuration

After logging into cloud.ticos.ai, the homepage displays your available agents by default. Here you can create and manage your agents.

This section will guide you through configuring embodied agents on the Ticos Cloud platform. Proper configuration is essential for customizing your agent's functionality, interaction methods, and personalized behavior.

The agent configuration interface includes multiple modules, each corresponding to different aspects of the agent. After selecting a specific agent, you can switch between and configure the following modules through the left navigation bar:
