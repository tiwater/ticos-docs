# Agent Configuration

This section provides a comprehensive guide to configuring your Embodied Agent on the cloud.ticos.ai platform. Proper configuration is key to tailoring your agent's capabilities, personality, and interaction style.

The agent configuration interface is divided into several main modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the agent's setup. You can navigate between these modules using the left-hand sidebar menu after selecting an agent.

Below is an overview of the main configuration modules:

- **[Dashboard](./agent-dashboard.mdx)**: Provides an overview of the agent's status and key information.
- **[Instructions](./agent-instructions.mdx)**: Define the core operational parameters for your agent, including its fundamental purpose, how it perceives its environment (vision, hearing), and how it reacts (speech, emotion, gesture, behavior).
- **[Knowledge](./agent-knowledge.mdx)**: Manage the knowledge base that your agent uses to draw information and answer queries.
- **[Skills](./agent-skills.mdx)**: Configure the tools and abilities your agent can utilize.
- **[Avatars](./agent-avatars.mdx)**: Customize the appearance and persona of your agent (links to global settings).
- **[Models](./agent-models.mdx)**: Manage the AI models that power your agent's various functions (links to global settings).
- **[Publish](./agent-publish.mdx)**: Review and deploy your agent's configuration changes.
- **[Advanced Settings](./agent-advanced-settings.mdx)**: Access settings for managing the agent itself, such as deletion.

Each module will be detailed in its respective sub-section. Please refer to the specific pages for in-depth instructions and feature descriptions.
