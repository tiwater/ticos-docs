# Agent Avatars

The "Avatars" section in the agent configuration is intended for managing the visual appearance and persona of your Embodied Agent. The avatar is the graphical representation of your agent that users interact with.

## Navigation and Functionality

- **Link to Global Settings**: From the agent-specific configuration menu, the "Avatars" link typically redirects to a global settings page, for example, `/en/settings/avatars` or `/en/settings/terminal-avatars`.
- **Purpose**: This section would ideally allow you to:
    - Select from a library of available avatars.
    - Customize avatar appearance (e.g., clothing, features, colors).
    - Manage avatar-specific animations or expressions (though detailed emotional/gesture expressions are often handled in their respective "Reaction" sub-modules).

## Current Status

**Please Note**: During the exploration of the `cloud.ticos.ai` platform (as of the last update of this document), the "Avatars" page (e.g., `/en/settings/avatars`) displayed the message: **"This feature is under development."** (see MEMORY[eb2b0bab-3efa-4e91-a558-c298f4c2d3ba]).

An earlier attempt to access `/en/settings/terminal-avatars` also resulted in a 404 error, further indicating that this functionality is not yet fully implemented or accessible.

Therefore, detailed documentation on avatar selection, customization, and management cannot be provided at this time.

This section will be updated if and when the "Avatars" module becomes fully operational and its features can be thoroughly reviewed.
