# Terminal Monitoring

The Terminal Monitoring functionality allows administrators to view real-time interactions between terminal devices and users. Through this feature, you can monitor conversation content, system events, and terminal performance for troubleshooting, quality control, and user experience optimization.

1. Real-time monitoring of conversations between terminals and users

4. Configuring advanced monitoring options

## Usage Process
