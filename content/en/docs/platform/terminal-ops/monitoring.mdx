# Terminal Monitoring

The Terminal Monitoring page provides a real-time view into the operations and interactions of your selected terminal devices. This feature is crucial for debugging, observing user interactions, and ensuring your Embodied Agents are performing as expected.

As stated on the page (e.g., `ref=e62`): "Select a group and terminal to begin monitoring. You will be able to view the live conversation between the selected terminal and human."

## Usage Flow

To start monitoring a terminal, follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate**: Access "Terminal Ops" from the main menu, then select "Monitoring".
2.  **Select Group**: From the "Select Group" dropdown (e.g., `ref=e68`), choose the group to which the target terminal belongs.
3.  **Select Terminal**: Once a group is selected, the "Select Terminal" dropdown (e.g., `ref=e82`) will populate. Choose the specific terminal you wish to monitor.
4.  **Advanced Settings (Optional)**: Click the "Advanced Settings" button (e.g., `ref=e88`) if you need to configure more specific monitoring parameters. (The exact nature of these settings may vary).
5.  **Connect**: Click the "Connect" button (e.g., `ref=e91`) to establish the monitoring session.
6.  **Remember Selection (Optional)**: If you frequently monitor the same terminal, check the "Remember selection" checkbox (e.g., `ref=e93`) to have your group and terminal choices pre-filled on your next visit.

## Monitoring Interface (Expected)

Once connected, you can typically expect to see several panels or areas displaying live data, which might include:

-   **Dialog Flow / Conversation Log**: A real-time transcript of interactions between the user and the agent operating on the terminal.
-   **System Logs**: Technical logs from the terminal, showing events, errors, or diagnostic information.
-   **Status Information**: Key status indicators from the terminal, such as connection strength, battery level, or agent state.
-   **Visual Feed (If Applicable)**: For terminals with cameras, there might be a section to view the live video stream or snapshots.

## Notes

-   The availability of groups and terminals depends on your setup in the "Terminals" section.
-   A stable network connection is required for uninterrupted monitoring.
-   The specific data and layout of the monitoring interface may vary based on the terminal type and platform version.
