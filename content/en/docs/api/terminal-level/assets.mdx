# Asset Management API

This document describes how to use the terminal-level Asset Management API, which allows you to upload and delete files using your terminal key. These APIs are typically used to upload images, PDFs, and other files collected by terminals to the cloud for subsequent processing by services such as Agent Responses.

## Upload File API

### API Description

```
POST https://api.ticos.ai/v1/assets
```

### Request Headers

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Content-Type | Yes | Fixed value: `multipart/form-data` |
| Authorization | Yes | Format: `Bearer <TerminalKey>`, terminal key can be obtained from the terminal details page |
| accept | No | Specifies the return format as JSON: `application/json` |

### Request Body

The request body should be formatted as multipart/form-data with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| file | File | Yes | The file to upload. Supports common document and media formats |

### Response

After a successful upload, the service returns JSON:

```json
{
  "url": "https://assets.ticos.ai/relative/path/to_file.pdf",
  "contentType": "application/pdf",
  "path": "relative/path/to_file.pdf"
}
```

The `url` field is the public access address of the file that can be used in other API calls.

## Delete File API

### API Description

```
DELETE https://api.ticos.ai/v1/assets
```

### Request Headers

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |

### Query Parameters

```

```

### Python

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.ticos.ai/v1/assets"
headers = {

  "Authorization": "Bearer <TerminalKey>"
}
files = {
  "file": open("/path/to/your/file.pdf", "rb")
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files)
print(response.json())
```

#### Delete File

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.ticos.ai/v1/assets"
params = {
  "url": "https://assets.ticos.ai/asset_123456789.pdf"
}
headers = {
  "Authorization": "Bearer <TerminalKey>"
}

response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers, params=params)
print(response.status_code)
```

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
| ----- | -------- |
| Returns 401 Unauthorized | Check if the terminal key in the `Authorization` header is correct and has not expired |
| Returns 400 Bad Request | Ensure the file format is supported and the file size is within limits |
| Returns 404 Not Found | Verify that the URL provided for deletion is correct and the file exists |
