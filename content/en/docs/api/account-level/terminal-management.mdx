# Terminal Management (Account Level)

These APIs are used to manage your terminals at an account level. Authentication for these APIs is done using your **Account API Key**.

## Authentication

All Account Level API endpoints require authentication using a Bearer Token. The token should be your **Account API Key**, passed through the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <account_api_key>
```

## API Endpoints

### Register New Terminal

Registers a new terminal to your account.

**Request:**
```http
POST /v1/terminals
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <account_api_key>
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "name_1",
  "identifier": "id_1",
  "model_id": 123,
  "description": "Terminal of model 123"
}
```

**Parameters:**

*   `name` (string, required): A user-defined name for the terminal.
*   `identifier` (string, required): A unique identifier for the terminal.
*   `model_id` (integer, required): The model ID associated with this terminal.
*   `description` (string, optional): A description for the terminal.

**Success Response (Example 201 Created):**

```json
{
	"name": "name_1",
	"identifier": "id_1",
	"status": "active",
	"model_id": 123,
	"secret": "ts_d2d5495765f1cdecd290b4a2d291b180", // This is the terminal's secret
	"description": "Terminal of model 123"
}
```

**Error Responses (Examples):**

*   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input (e.g., missing required fields, identifier not unique).
    ```json
    {
      "detail": "A terminal with this identifier already exists for this model"
    }
    ```
*   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failed (e.g., invalid account API key).
*   `500 Internal ServerError`: Server-side error.

> **Note:** The exact success and error response structures, as well as status codes, should be confirmed with the API implementation. The `Host` should be updated to the production API endpoint.
