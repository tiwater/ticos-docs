# Ticos API Overview

Welcome to the Ticos Platform API documentation. Our APIs are designed to provide comprehensive control and integration capabilities for your terminals and account.

## API Categories

Our APIs are broadly categorized into two main levels:

1.  **Account Level APIs:** These APIs are used for managing resources and configurations at the account scope. Authentication typically requires an Account API Key.
    *   [Terminal Management](./api/account-level/terminal-management) - Manage registration and configuration of your terminals.

2.  **Terminal Level APIs:** These APIs are used for interactions specific to an individual terminal, such as managing face data or real-time operations. Authentication typically requires a Terminal-specific Secret or API Key.
    *   [Face Management](./api/terminal-level/face-management) - Manage facial recognition data on a specific terminal.

## Authentication

Authentication methods vary based on the API level:
*   **Account Level APIs:** Typically use an `Account API Key` as a Bearer Token.
*   **Terminal Level APIs:** Typically use a `Terminal Secret` as a Bearer Token.

Please refer to the specific documentation for each API group for detailed authentication instructions.

## Base URL

The base URL for Ticos API endpoints is:
`https://api.ticos.ai/v1`

## API Versioning

All API endpoints are versioned. The current version is `v1`.

We recommend reviewing the "Best Practices" sections within each API group for guidance on security, error handling, and performance.
