# Terminal Quick Start

This document uses a "robot terminal" scenario as an example to help you quickly complete the following tasks on the **Ticos Cloud** platform:

1. Create a robot terminal model.
2. Create a terminal device and obtain the terminal key.
3. Obtain the Agent ID.
4. Install and configure **ticos-agent** on the device.
5. Start the agent and integrate with the SDK for development.

## 1. Log in to the Platform

Visit [https://cloud.ticos.ai](https://cloud.ticos.ai) and log in with your administrator account.

## 2. Create a Robot Terminal Model

1. Select **Settings → Terminal Models → Add Model** from the sidebar.

![Add Terminal Model](/images/quickstart-terminal/image2.png)

2. Fill in the following information in the popup:
   - **Terminal Type**: Select `Robot`.
   - **Brand / Manufacturer**, **Model Name**, **Description**: Fill in according to your actual situation.
   - Upload a device photo and check **Published**.

3. Click **Save**.

The interface after saving will look like this:

2. Fill in the form:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Name | Any easily identifiable name |
| Terminal ID | Unique device ID (can be auto-generated by clicking) |
| Terminal Model | Select the robot model created in step 2 |
| Location, Description, etc. | Fill in as needed |

3. Click **Save**.

If you need to create multiple devices at once, you can use the **Batch Create Terminals** feature and download the list of terminal IDs and keys.

In the terminal list, click **View Details** in the **Actions** column to copy the terminal **API Key**, which will be used for device configuration later.

## 4. Obtain the Agent ID

1. Select **Embodied Agents** (or the name of the most recently visited agent) from the top navigation bar.

2. Create a new agent or select an existing one, then click **Configure**. For detailed agent configuration, please refer to the [Agent Configuration](../platform/agent-configuration/agent-configuration) documentation.
3. The last group of numbers in the browser address bar is the **Agent ID**. Please record it for later use when configuring ticos-agent.

## 5. Install ticos-agent

Currently, only Linux (Aarch64) systems are supported. If you need support for other systems, please contact the Ticos team.

Obtain the installation package `ticos-agent-<version>-arm64.deb` from the Ticos team, copy it to the target device, and execute:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i ticos-agent-<version>-arm64.deb
```

> The version number depends on the actual package.

---

## 6. Configure ticos-agent

Execute:

```bash
ticos-agent config
```

Follow the wizard to input or select:

```text
? Enter agent ID (agent_id) · <AgentID>
? Select API service address › wss://stardust2.ticos.cn
? Enter API key · <Terminal Key>
? Select your microphone › HK-DXMIC-V1.0 Analog Stereo
? Select your speaker › HK-DXMIC-V1.0 Analog Stereo
Do you have a camera? (y/n) › y
? Select your camera › USB Camera 1080P
VAD threshold (%) · 60
VAD silence threshold (dB) · -20
VAD silence minimum duration (ms) · 200
? Enter actuator address · 127.0.0.1:9999
```

## 7. SDK Development

To enable applications to communicate with ticos-agent and utilize its capabilities, you need to use the ticos-client SDK.

### Obtain the SDK

- GitHub repository: [https://github.com/tiwater/ticos-client](https://github.com/tiwater/ticos-client)
- Supported languages:
  - Python
  - Java (not synchronized, please contact the Ticos team if needed)
  - Other languages are under development

### Run Example Code

Before developing your own application, we recommend running the example code to experience the functionality.

#### Python Example

1. Clone the repository to your terminal device:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tiwater/ticos-client.git
cd ticos-client/examples/python
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the example:

```bash
python Main.py
```

---

## 8. Start ticos-agent

On your terminal device, open a new command line window and start ticos-agent in one of the following ways:

### Direct Run

```bash
ticos-agent start
```

### Start as a User Service (Recommended)

```bash
systemctl --user start ticos-agent
```

View Logs

```bash
journalctl --user -u ticos-agent -f
```

Stop ticos-agent

```bash
systemctl --user stop ticos-agent
```

When you hear a "beep" sound, it means the connection to the cloud is successful. You can now interact with the agent via the device's microphone.

---

## 9. Integrate into Your Own Application

Through the ticos-client SDK and ticos-agent, you can implement the following functions:

- **Voice Interaction**: Send voice streams and receive speech synthesis results
- **Text Dialogue**: Send text prompt messages and receive agent responses
- **Image Stream Recognition**: Send image streams and obtain analysis results, face recognition results, etc.
- **Action Control**: Receive action commands generated by the agent

After integrating the SDK, you can call large model capabilities, action commands, and other functions to implement custom robot applications.

---

After completing the above steps, your robot terminal has successfully connected to **Ticos Cloud** and you can start developing embodied intelligence applications.
