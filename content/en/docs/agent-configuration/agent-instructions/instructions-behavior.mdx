# Behavior (Reaction)

The "Behavior" settings, intended to be part of the "Instructions" -> "Reaction" module, are designed to allow configuration of broader behavioral patterns and complex responses for your Embodied Agent.

## Intended Functionality

While the specific interface and options for this section are currently unavailable, typical "Behavior" configurations in agent systems might include:

- **Rule-based Behaviors**: Defining specific actions or sequences of actions to be taken in response to certain triggers or conditions.
- **State Management**: Configuring how the agent transitions between different behavioral states (e.g., idle, active, listening, responding).
- **Proactive Behaviors**: Setting up conditions under which the agent might initiate actions or conversations without direct user prompting.
- **Behavioral Scripts**: Potentially a way to script more complex, multi-step interactions or routines.

## Current Status

**Please Note**: During the exploration of the `cloud.ticos.ai` platform (as of the last update of this document), the "Behavior" configuration page (`/en/agents/33/behavior`) was **inaccessible and returned a 404 error**.

Therefore, detailed documentation on its features and configuration options cannot be provided at this time.

This section will be updated if and when the "Behavior" module becomes available and its functionalities can be thoroughly reviewed.
