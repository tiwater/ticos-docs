# Advanced Agent Settings

The "Advanced Settings" module provides access to critical, often destructive, operations related to the management of your Embodied Agent.

## Overview

When you navigate to the "Advanced Settings" page (e.g., `/en/agents/33/settings`), you will typically see:

- **Page Title**: "Agent Settings"
- **Subtitle/Description**: "Advanced settings for current embodied agent."

## Key Features and Actions

### 1. Delete Embodied Agent

This is the primary feature usually found in the Advanced Settings section.

- **Section Title**: "Delete Embodied Agent" (e.g., `ref=e155` from exploration).
- **Warning/Description**: A prominent warning message is typically displayed, emphasizing the permanent nature of this action. For example: "This action cannot be undone. Your agent and all its data will be permanently deleted." (e.g., `ref=e157`).
- **Delete Agent Button** (e.g., `ref=e159` from exploration):
    - **Functionality**: Clicking this button initiates the process of permanently deleting the current agent.
    - **Confirmation**: It is highly likely that a confirmation dialog will appear after clicking this button to prevent accidental deletion. You will need to confirm your intention to delete the agent.

## Important Considerations

- **Irreversibility**: Deleting an agent is a permanent action. All associated configurations, knowledge base items, and any other data linked specifically to that agent will be lost and cannot be recovered.
- **Caution**: Exercise extreme caution when using this feature. Ensure you have backed up any necessary information or are certain that the agent is no longer needed before proceeding with deletion.

This section is reserved for high-impact operations. Always double-check which agent you are managing before performing actions within Advanced Settings.
