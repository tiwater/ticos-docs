# Agent Models

The "Models" section in the agent configuration is intended for managing the underlying Artificial Intelligence (AI) models that power your Embodied Agent's various capabilities, such as language understanding, generation, vision, and speech.

## Navigation and Functionality

- **Link to Global Settings**: From the agent-specific configuration menu, the "Models" link typically redirects to a global settings page, for example, `/en/settings/terminal-models`.
- **Purpose**: This section would ideally allow you to:
    - Select or assign specific AI models for different agent functions (e.g., a language model for conversation, a vision model for image processing).
    - Manage model versions or switch between different available models.
    - Configure model-specific parameters if applicable.
    - View information about the models currently in use by the agent.

## Current Status

**Please Note**: During the exploration of the `cloud.ticos.ai` platform (as of the last update of this document), the "Models" page (`/en/settings/terminal-models`) **displayed only an image** (e.g., `ref=e65` from exploration). There were no visible configuration options or textual information (see MEMORY[eb2b0bab-3efa-4e91-a558-c298f4c2d3ba]).

This suggests that the functionality for managing agent models through this interface is either under development, not yet populated with content, or accessed differently.

Therefore, detailed documentation on model selection, configuration, and management cannot be provided at this time.

This section will be updated if and when the "Models" module becomes fully operational and its features can be thoroughly reviewed.
